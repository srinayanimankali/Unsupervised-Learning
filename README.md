# Unsupervised-Learning
The first part of the project predicts the miles per gallon (mpg) of the vehicles. It clusters the vehicles based on fuel consumption attributes using the K-means clustering. Further, I evaluate the performance of the
clustering by using the linear regression model. The project uses principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of the dataset.

The second part generates synthetic data using existing partially labelled data provided for a wine manufacturer.

The third part of the project classifies the vehicles based on the given description. The silhouette consists of the geometric features of the vehicle. It classifies the data into three types of vehicles, using a set of
features extracted from the silhouette. The three types of vehicles are cars, vans, and buses. The project uses PCA to reduce the dimensions of the dataset and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to
classify the vehicles.

The fourth part designs a performance ranking model for professional cricket players in IPL.
